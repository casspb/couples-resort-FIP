              <p>
                Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected
                from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned
                park in Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the
                maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893,
                the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park
                are home to a diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be
                found nowhere else on earth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the
                distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin.
                These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark
                beauty. This, combined with its location, 3 hours northeast of
                Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal
                attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city.
              </p>

              <p>
                This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is
                awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty
                of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its
                fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and
                hundreds of pristine lakes. It is impressive.
              </p>

              <p>
                Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort,
                Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and
                rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a
                living link with a vanishing past.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30 species of
                mammals, many are nocturnal or mostly subterranean and therefore
                not encountered. Listed are most commonly seen mammals, birds
                and reptilesin the Algonquin Park & Area.
              </p>

              <p>
                Visit Algonquin and hear for the first and only time in your
                lives the mournful howl of a wolf? See first-hand — in Algonquin
                and nowhere else — a reasonable facsimile of the wilderness that
                once covered all of Ontario?

                to provide enhanced fishing opportunities to anglers. Each
                species of sport fish has a regulated open and closed season.

                Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with
                direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally named Long lake
                which was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders
                Nightengale and Airy townships.
              </p>

              <p>
                Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and
                extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park . Explore
                the many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons,
                beaver, otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go
                for a swim.
              </p>

              <p>
                Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with
                water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July.
                Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third
                week of June to the first week of September.
